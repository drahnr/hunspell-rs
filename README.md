# Rust bindings for Hunspell

Not all Hunspell features are supported yet. Most notably, it's not possible to
change the dictionary at runtime.

Available from crates.io as `hunspell-rs`, based on [`hunspell-rust`](https://github.com/lipk/hunspell-rust)
but building on top of `hunspell-sys`.

All feature flags from `hunspell-sys` exposed by this libaray.
